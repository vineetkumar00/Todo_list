#Todo_List 
Backend Project
Overview
This to-do list application is designed to simplify task management and boost productivity by helping users schedule and track their daily tasks effectively. The project features a robust backend built using Node.js and Express.js, with PostgreSQL as the database for storing tasks. The frontend is powered by Embedded JavaScript (EJS), providing a clean and interactive user experience.

Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Frontend: Embedded JavaScript (EJS), HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Database: PostgreSQL
Other Tools: Sequelize (ORM for PostgreSQL), dotenv (for environment variables), bcrypt (for password hashing), and session management (for user authentication).

PUT /tasks/:id – Update a specific task
DELETE /tasks/:id – Delete a task
PATCH /tasks/:id/status – Mark task as complete

Deployment & Scalability
Hosted on Render, Heroku, or AWS for backend deployment.
Database hosted on Supabase or ElephantSQL for reliable PostgreSQL hosting.
Load balancing and caching (e.g., Redis) can be implemented for performance optimization.

Future Enhancements
Mobile App Integration – Build a mobile version using React Native or Flutter.
AI-Powered Task Suggestions – Predict and recommend tasks based on user behavior.
Collaboration Features – Allow users to share tasks and collaborate with teams.
